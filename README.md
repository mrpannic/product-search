### Setup
- There is a script that can be used to get the whole project up but you will have to install and start `docker`
- To use the script you can type the next commands: 
    ```
    ./canoe up - for building an image and starting the container
    ./canoe down - for stopping all of the containers for this project
    ./canoe backup - backs up the database

     ** please note that it may take some time to start the db container
    ```
